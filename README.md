================

After inheriting a bunch of code using PHP's old-style MySQL interface functions, I stuck with that style for a while. Ready for a change, I'm starting to learn the PDO style *and* trying to class-ify as much of my code as makes sense. So this is what I'm using for database interfactions now.
